# SongSearch
This project was written in Java and was the culmination of 4 projects over the semester

Proj1 - Create a Song Class and a SongCollection Class that used an ArrayList to read in songs from a text file which was then
converted to a Song[] array.

Proj2 - Create a Ragged Array List of songs. Create a SearchByTitlePrefix Class which searches through the Ragged Array List by
title prefix. Example - List 10 song titles that start with "T".

Proj3 - Create a SearchByLyricsWords Class that utilized TreeSets and TreeMaps. This should locate any song that contains every
word entered by the user.

Proj4 - Create a SearchByLyricsPhrase Class using any data structure you desired. This located the exact lyrics phrase entered
by the user in order and give that phrase a ranking.
